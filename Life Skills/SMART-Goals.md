Objective: Teach the S.M.A.R.T. goal-setting framework.
Present and define each component of the S.M.A.R.T. acronym: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-based.
Provide examples of poorly constructed goals vs. well-constructed S.M.A.R.T. goals (e.g., "Get better grades" vs. "Improve my math grade from a C to a B by the end of the semester by studying 3 hours weekly").
Discuss why each component is critical for successful goal-setting.
3. Guided Practice (Time: 15 minutes)
Objective: Help students brainstorm and draft S.M.A.R.T. goals with teacher support.
Lead a discussion on possible goal areas (e.g., personal life, education, career, and manhood development).
Have students share examples and refine them as a class using the S.M.A.R.T. criteria.
4. Independent Practice (Time: 15 minutes)
Objective: Allow students to independently create three personalized S.M.A.R.T. goals.
Students will open a new Google Doc attached to the classroom assignment.
They will write three S.M.A.R.T. goals, choosing from the provided categories (e.g., personal, Hidden Genius participation, education, professional development, or manhood development).

Evaluate students’ S.M.A.R.T. goals submitted via Google Docs for completeness, clarity, and alignment with the framework.
Provide individualized feedback on the feasibility and specificity of their goals.
Extra Activities:

Create an action plan detailing steps to achieve one of their S.M.A.R.T. goals.
Reflect on potential challenges and solutions for each goal.
Reflection / Takeaways:
After teaching, evaluate student engagement and comprehension during the guided practice.
Note areas where students struggled to apply the S.M.A.R.T. framework and plan additional scaffolding if needed.
