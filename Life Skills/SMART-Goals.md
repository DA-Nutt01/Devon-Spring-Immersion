In this lesson, you will learn a very core skill to a successful and productive life: Goal Setting! Setting basic goals for oneself is a good way to stay on track and ensure you are always making progress, but there are better ways than others to do so. We will be learning about a tried and true form of goal setting called S.M.A.R.T. goals. 

S (Specific) - Keep Goals very specific and narrow so that it's clear what you trying to achieve
M (Measurable) - Establish metrics to ensure you are on track and hit your goals
A (Attainable) - You should be able to achieve this goal within a reasonable timeframe
R (Relevant) - Your goals should align with the org's strategic & business objectives
T (Time-Based) - There should be a specific end date for your goals & milestones leading up to it

Activity.
Create a new google doc attached to this assignment for you to take your notes.
Create AT LEAST 3 S.M.A.R.T goals you will commit yourself to. Choose 3 of the following options:
- Personal - What is a goal you have in general for yourself in your personal life?
- Hidden Genius - What is a goal you have within being a Genius inside the Hidden Genius Project?
- Education - What is a goal you have for yourself in regards to school?
- Professional - What is a goal you have for building your career or developing yourself as a professional?
- Manhood Development - What is a goal you have for developing yourself as a young man? Think of the lenses we discussed in our conversation: Culture, Psychological, Social, Spirit, Physical, Economic

Be fair and honest with yourself when writing your goals. Consider what you are reasonably able to commit to accomplishing and smash those goals!
